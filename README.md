# Prime Digital Academy Assignment - Weekend Challenge 4

This assignment is hosted online [here](https://stormy-wave-34613.herokuapp.com/)!

Our task for this assignment was to create a full stack application from the ground up utilizing using jQuery, Node, MongoDB, and Bootstrap. We were provided with property data, and tasked with displaying different property types in a meaningful way on the DOM. Additionally, we had to create a way for a user to add additional listings to the site. Finally, we needed to host the application using Heroku and mLabs.

This challenge took place about halfway through my time at Prime Digital Academy.
